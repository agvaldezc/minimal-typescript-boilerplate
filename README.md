# Minimal boilerplate setup for Typescript project.
This repo provides a quick way to create and start working on a simple local environment using Typescript.

# Installation
To start working with this boilerplate simply...
```bash
git clone https://github.com/agvaldezc/minimal-typescript-boilerplate.git

cd minimal-typescript-boilerplate

npm install
```
... and now you're good to go!

# How to use
The boilerplate contains 3 different npm scripts to use:
* `start:dev` starts the project and detects changes on the source folder to re-transpile TS code into JS.
* `build` generate a build of your project without any other additional action.
*  `start` generates a build and runs the main file of your project.
